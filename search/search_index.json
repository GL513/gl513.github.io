This is especially handy for Discord moderation, and other social platforms.  When deleting images, they are nearly unrecoverable without additional tools. However, when browsing the internet, your browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, will save these images until your session ends.  When an image appears in your browser, it almost always gets cached, in some form or another. The only time when an image is not cached, is when it's just too big to be cached. In this case, it will create a thumbnail. A thumbnail is a smaller, leaner version of the original image, with the cost of quality. Most thumbnails are no larger than 300 pixels tall. In fact, most are a lot smaller.  This means that if you send a rather large image, it likely won't be saved how it was originally. Although, if an image smaller than 300 pixels is too small, there is still hope.  The way that Firefox's and Chrome's cache works is nothing new, really. It saves whatever it wants, and if it needs to do something with those files, it can. This includes web links.  Web links are handy because they give you the origin of whatever you are looking for. This could include javascript, videos, images, and other objects. This guide can not only be applied to images, but any publicly accessible file, such as an image uploaded to Discord.  </p>","tags":["Discord","Recover","Image","Picture","Deleted","Social","Guide","How To","Help"]},{"location":"blog/1/#demonstration","title":"Demonstration","text":"<p>To demonstrate, I am using Discord, a popular channel-based internet chat. </p> <p>Unfortunately...</p> <p>To use this image recovery process with Discord, you have to keep a window open in the specific channel or chat you want to recover things from all the time.

The aim of this project is to allow anyone to map their buttons in any combination to anything. The original application is by Seth Schroeder, better known by sds100. It's development was started in 2019 while Seth was still in high school. It was really more of a pet than a product. Now it's evolved into the best free, libre, and open source key mapping Android application, with over one million downloads in the Google Play store. As of Febuary 1st, 2023, The app has an average rating of 3.8 stars from over 15.7 thousand reviews. As stated in it's GitHub page, the applicationis free and open source. The Google Play page even states that no data is shared with third parties, and that no data is collected at all.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Seth has had to dedicate more time to school and work, leaving Key Mapper unmaintained. The official note stating this was posted to the Key Mapper Discord at the end of 2022.</p>  Well, working on this project was a fun ride! This project has taught me so much about Android, software development and how to collaborate with an online community. It has been my dream to lead a big FOSS project with people from all over the world so a huge thank you goes to everyone that spread the word and helped on GitHub along the way. Unfortunately, I do not have any more time to work on this project - I'm now studying Computer Science at university and I have landed software-dev side jobs, which has taken up any free-time I did have to code on the side.   A special thank you goes to everyone in the Team for their long-term committment to the project and for being so engaged with the community. The Discord server, website and app store listing will still be up! So don't worry, you can still map your keys to your heart's content.  sds100, December 11, 2022 <p>However, even though Seth is done with development for now, that doesn't mean you can't help keep it going. Due to the nature of open source, you can make changes to the Key Mapper code yourself.
