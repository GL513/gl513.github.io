# About GL

###

Hello, my name is Gavin, also known as GL, and GL513 in online communitites.<br>
I've been a huge tech geek since I was little, and I still am, helping others with their projects, such as [Key Mapper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.sds100.keymapper&hl=en_US&gl=US) by [sds100](https://github.com/sds100/).<br><br>
I hope that one day I can develop my own apps, like [Key Mapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/keymapper/), or [Shortcut Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rk.android.app.shortcutmaker&hl=en_US&gl=US), especially since I literally always try to make things better :)<br><br>
