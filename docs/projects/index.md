# Projects: About

<p style="font-size:25px">Things That Are Never Done</p>
I classify "Projects" as things that I work with on and off, and it usually takes me forever to complete, or it will never be done.<br>
If it will never be "done" then that can be either good or bad.<br>
Bad in the sense that a Project becomes abandoned, and good in the sense that I am actively maintaining a Project that is impossible to complete, such as my 0jEdge theming project.
