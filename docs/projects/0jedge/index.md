# 0jEdge

### Awesome Colors Without Eye Bleach. With a zer0.

0jEdge has always been a work-in-progress Project. It's my signature pallete.
I've been working on it on and off for years for the few applications I used, including [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/), [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/), Telegram, Telegram X, [Kustom](https://help.kustom.rocks/) and [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/). You can also see that these Pages are styled with the 0jEdge theme. <br>
Of course I would like to theme more things, although I need to have some self discipline and finish my original applications.
