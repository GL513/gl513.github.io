# ChatKC

ChatKC is a specialized WSS (**W**eb**S**ocket **S**ecure)  chat created by the popular youtuber, [MattKC](https://www.youtube.com/mattkc).

ChatKC is different because it uses Google oAuth to authenticate users to the server after sign in.

After the user is authenticated, they may chat on the MattKC site, or on an alternative, unofficial specialized client.

Work is being done to fully reverse-engineer the ChatKC usage, so that others can make a decentralized network of ChatKC-style servers.

The main git repository is by Breadpudding[^1] on his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cbpudding/chatkc), while I have my fork hosted [here](https://github.com/gl513/chatkcprotocol).

Currently, I do minor documentation things and testing for random stuff, like [Platapai's[^2] Discord to ChatKC bridge](https://discord.gg/GgyQ6uZhzu)
