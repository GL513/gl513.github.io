# Playlists

I often make playlists, most of the time to make collections of songs that fit together, like some themed playlists, or even playlist mixes, where I try to match up every song together as tightly as possible.<br>
This is a small amount of playlists that are updated every now and then, as I have more playlists, but those are really either barely used or are just a few smaller things that don't really matter. <br>
If you would like to see more than what is displayed here, you can check out my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/nri269uwkgy22rauszevi59w2).

### [Hype Wubs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NEaVffXCqMecYtTU5F4M9)
Dubstep for the hyperactive. Includes ColorBass, and a bit of riddim-style songs.
