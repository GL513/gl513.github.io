# Playlists

I often make playlists, most of the time to make collections of songs that fit together, like some themed playlists, or even playlist mixes, where I try to match up every song together as tightly as possible.<br>
This is a small amount of playlists that are updated every now and then, as I have more playlists, but those are really either barely used or are just a few smaller things that don't really matter. <br>
If you would like to see more than what is displayed here, you can check out my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/nri269uwkgy22rauszevi59w2).

## [GL513 Community Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/46xNoSOge0mUgBn5jnQp5b?si=3e216b5b4fa64c33)
My community playlist where others can add their own favorite songs. You can request collaborator's access in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PjPYjHH2Qn).

## [Hype Wubs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NEaVffXCqMecYtTU5F4M9)
Dubstep for the hyperactive. Includes ColorBass, and a bit of riddim-style songs.

## [Fuzz](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2glVobIfWztYSC3jlEkdc5?si=84872cde75b84819)
Some personally nostalgic songs I listened to during 2020-2022. A good amount of these are from my SoundCloud playlist, [The Most Noise](https://soundcloud.com/user-386475998/sets/the-most-noise), although some aren't even dubstep, like a lot of my music is.
